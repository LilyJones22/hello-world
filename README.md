# hello-world
My name is Lily and I love playing video games and my cats. I also enjoy various means of creative expression, including drawing and storytelling. I also enjoy messing with various craft mediums on occasion, however I bounce between them often, as I can't seem to stay interested in one type for an extended period of time
